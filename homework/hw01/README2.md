# CPTR 141: Homework Assignment #1

## Problem Overview

Your task in this homework assignment is to write a program to construct a mad-libs-like version of the introduction to *StarTrek*. 
Your program should perform the following tasks:

1. Ask the user for words as shown below.  Do not worry (for this assignment) about checking the user input. 
    * a noun
    * a second noun
    * a number
    * a measure of time
    * an adjective
    * a second adjective
    * a verb
  
2. Your program should then print out the opening of StarTrek with the words provided by the user filled in as appropriate. 


## Solution Specifications

Your solution to this problem must meet the following criteria.

1. You must use `cout` to display output and `cin` to collect seven words from the user, as outlined above.

2. You must use a different appropriately-named variable of type `string` to store each of the words entered by the user.

3. You **must** produce output exactly as shown below assuming the given words were entered by the user.

```
Enter a noun: Pizza
Enter a second noun: windmill
Enter a number: seven
Enter a measure of time: second
Enter an adjective: silly
Enter a second adjective: weird
Enter a verb: dance

Pizza, the final frontier
These are the voyages of the windmill Enterprise
Its seven second mission
To explore silly new worlds
To seek out weird life
And weird civilizations
To boldly dance where no one has gone before
```
