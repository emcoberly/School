How to achieve 7 using rods of lengths 4 and 9 units:

1.	Start at position 0.
2.	Use the 9-unit rod to measure 9 units to the right.
3.	Mark the position.
4.	Use the 4-unit rod to measure 4 units to the left.
5.	Mark the position.
6.	Repeat steps 2-5 two more times.
7.	Use the 4-unit rod to measure 4 units to the left.
8.	Mark the position.
9.  Repeat steps 7 and 8 once.
10.	You now have marked a 7-unit length from the start position.


How to achieve 7 using rods of lengths 'm' and 'n' units:

Assumptions:
'm' and 'n' are coprime
'm' < 'n'

1.  Start at position 0.
2.  Use the 'm'-unit rod to measure 'm' units to the right.
3.  Mark the position.
4.  If the mark is less than 7 units from the start:
        (a) Use the 'm'-unit rod to measure 'm' units to the right.
        (b) Mark the position.
5.  If the mark is more than 7 units from the start:
        (a) Use the 'n'-unit rod to measure 'n' units to the left.
        (b) Mark the position.
6.  Repeat steps 4 and 5 until one of the rods reaches exactly 7.
7.  You now have marked a 7-unit length from the start position.
